# precision-farming
The farm monitoring system is a mixture of hardware and software additives. 
The hardware part includes embedded systems and software program is the Arduino ide.
The Arduino ide displays readings from sensors are inserted using the hardware.The special sensors used
are temperature and humidity sensor,pir sensor and soil moisture sensor. The facts gathered with the aid of the sensors is sent to the Arduino UNO microcontroller ATmega328
.The gathered information may be displayed in a Arduino IDE.
A GSM module is hooked up with the Arduino to facilitate messaging service which updates the farmers each 10 seconds approximately the climate conditions of the subject.
IV.HARDWARE USED This project is aided with many hardwares. This proposed technology is an amalgamation of different sensors,
microcontroller and communication medium to help the farmers to work on their farms.

A.Arduino uno

Arduino is a microcontroller to control the working of the sensors and manage the working of the device. The Uno version of Arduino is implemented in this project. It was developed by Arduino CC. The Arduino board comes with various number of pins. The pins are categorized as output and input pins. The input pins ac cepts digital as well as analog pins. It has 14 digital pins and 6 analog pins. It accepts 7 to 20 volts of power for working. It also has an USB port. The Uno was the first version of Arduino to be introduced in the Arduino family.

B.DHT11 Temperature And Humidity Sensor

The DHT11 Temperature And Humidity sensor is used to sense temperature and humidity present in the atmosphere. It has 3 pins generally. One pin is used for transmitting signals, the next pin is used to receive signals and the last pin is data transfer. It can be used for prolonged time period. It gives approximate results. It regularly sends information to Arduino Uno. The information consists the signals which contain the values gathered about temperature and humidity. It is reliable on nature. It gives a very fast response.

C.Soil Moisture sensor

The Soil Moisture sensor is used to sense moisture content in the soil. It checks the volume of water content or moisture present in the soil. The calculations are done in the soil moisture sensor through coefficients. It estimates the volume of water content in the soil. It detects the water content in the soil and gets and sends the analog signals which is shown digitally. It transmits the the signals containing information or data or values of the condition of soil to Arduino to futher process it and display.
D.PIR Sensor

PIR sensor stands for Passive Infrared Sensor. It detects the movement around it and sends the signals accordingly. It radiates electromagnetic radiation. It hits the object and comes back to the PIR sensor telling that there is presence of an object in a specified range. An led or Buzzer can be attached with PIR sensor so that the hindrance can be detected easily. It will help the farmer to know if any animal has broken into field and is destroying crops. In this way the farmer can save his crops.
